# The blog project
This is a blog platform that is supposed to be listening on a Tor hidden service for files in the
Markdown format and convert these into html and post as a blogpost on a homepage in vanilla internet

## Idea
To let people in areas with alot of censorship and filtering to share their thoughts and information
in a manner that anonymizes their posting to this blog but still get the information out

## Parts used in the project
I have used the [web.py] [1] for the webserver bits, [Python Markdown] [2] by Manfred Stienstra and others, [Elixir] [3] by Jonathan LaCour, Daniel Haus and GaÃ«tan de Menten and [pysqlite] [4] by Michael Owens. The rest of it is my code :)

## State
At the moment it is just in it's cradle, the pieces of code I have put together so far is only a small Proof of Concept I 
am making for the CCCamp 2011. 
Many of the final details when this all is "production ready" might change.

## License
I am releasing everything under the GPLv2 license, feel free to copy, fork, improve or just look at the code.
